        Christian Orient and Byzantium - Corpus Project
    </h1>
    <p class="card card-body card-text">
        This Digital Humanities project furthers global knowledge of the
        culture, heritage, languages, history, and society of Oriental
        Christians, from late ancient times, through the Middle Ages, and
        into the present. In a first step, this project provides
        bibliographical resources. These data can be accessed in different
        ways, including global searching or filtering according to specific
        traditions, for instance, searching for bibliographical entries
        that pertain to Armenian Studies, Georgian Studies, Syriac Studies,
        Christian Arabic Studies, Coptic Studies, Ethiopic Studies,
        Byzantine Studies, or Eastern Mediterranean Studies. As we obtain
        further funds, we will expand the data. With additional resources,
        we will also add other resources.
